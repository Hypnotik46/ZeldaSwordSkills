 * 
 * Base class for active skills. Extend this class to add specific functionality.
 * 
 * Note that additional fields in child classes are not saved to NBT, so should not be
 * used to store any data that needs to be maintained between game sessions.
 * 
 * Unless the skill's activation is handled exclusively by the client side, ONLY activate or trigger
 * the skill on the server, as a packet will be sent automatically to notify the client
 * 
 * Each Skill should contain the following documentation followed by a full description
 * 
 * NAME: name of the skill
 * Description: one-line summary of skill
 * Activation:  Standard - activated by selecting the skill in the Skill Bar and pressing 'x'
 * 				Triggered - this skill can not be directly activated by the player
 * 				(toggle) - this skill is toggled on or off when activated
 * 				other - give details of how to activate the skill
 * Exhaustion: format is [0.0F +- (amount * level)]
 * Damage: if any, give the amount and additional details as necessary
 * Duration: if any, give the amount in ticks or seconds, as applicable
 * Range: if restricted, give the range in an applicable format, such as in blocks
 * Area: if any, give the dimensions and additional details as necessary
 * Special: any special notes
 * 
 * Full description goes here.
